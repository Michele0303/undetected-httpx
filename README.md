# undetected-httpx

**An HTTP probing toolkit inspired by httpx, powered by curl_cffi with browser-grade TLS and HTTP fingerprinting.**

`undetected-httpx` is a fast and flexible HTTP probing tool designed for modern web environments where traditional HTTP clients are easily fingerprinted or blocked.

By leveraging `curl_cffi` and `curl-impersonate`, it can mimic real browser TLS, JA3, and HTTP/2 fingerprints, making it suitable for reconnaissance, research, and large-scale HTTP probing.
